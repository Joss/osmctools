osm-c-tools - Notes for development
-----------------------------------

- If you're cloning the repository for the first time, you need to run
  `autoreconf --install` to generate all the autotools files. These
  should be ignored by the /.gitignore file, please add patterns as
  appropriate.

- Autotools-generated files should NEVER be committed to the
  repository (that's why we're ignoring them) -- just edit the proper
  files if you need to change behaviour (configure.ac and Makefile.am)

- Each time you change one of the files above, run `autoreconf
  --install` to ensure everything is ok. Always assume malicious
  users :)

- When releasing a tarball, increase the version number in
  configure.ac, and run:

      $ autoreconf --install
      $ ./configure
      $ make dist-all

  This will create a properly named and versioned tarball, ready
  for users to compile and install.

- Each time you run `./configure`, please make sure to run
  `make distclean` afterwards, to ensure no generated files are
  seen as 'unstaged' by git. These could also be put in /.gitignore,
  really.
